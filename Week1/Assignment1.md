# 1. AIOps

>AIOps platforms utilize big data, modern machine learning and other advanced analytics technologies to directly and indirectly enhance IT operations (monitoring, automation and >service desk) functions with proactive, personal and dynamic insight. AIOps platforms enable the concurrent use of multiple data sources, data collection methods, analytical >real-time and deep) technologies, and presentation technologies.

## AIOps and DevOps
>To assist DevOps teams in handling routine IT tasks. By applying AI and machine learning algorithms to the monitoring data, AIOps can learn an environment’s behaviours and >generate alerts accordingly. Based on the anomalies detected, AIOps will be able to correlate important alerts from all sources into actionable, contextual insights, thus >enabling DevOps automation. A comprehensive AIOps solution will also be able to identify root causes and impacts, and prescribes potential solutions based on previous resolution >steps and feedback.

From my understanding it seems all connected and are seperated by a fine line . AIOps inclucates the basic principles of DevOps while it helps bring solution to the problems by automating most stuff of analyzing and enchancing performace by continuous evaluation of the system

## AIOps and MLOps
Even if both share this willingness to make our systems better and more efficient, the two fields overlap but do not meet under the same umbrella, neither in terms of the approach nor in terms of the raison d'être.

While MLOps' goal is bridging the gap between data scientists and operation teams, therefore between ML model building and their execution, AIOps focuses on automating incidents management and intelligent root cause analysis.

### *Conclusion*
Taking MLOps a step further , AIOps tend to automate systems by by collecting processing and observing intelligently the IT operations . AIOps have the capability to solve problems without human intervention , and is the future of IT Ops .
